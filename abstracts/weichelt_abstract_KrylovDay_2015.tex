In order to explore boundary feedback stabilization of coupled flow
problems, we consider the Navier-Stokes equations that describe
instationary, incompressible flows coupled with a diffusion convection
equation. Using a standard finite element discretization, we get a
differential-algebraic system of differential index two. We show how
to reduce this index with a projection method to get a generalized
state space system, where a linear quadratic control approach can be
applied.

This leads to large-scale saddle point systems which have to be solved
in a threefold nested iteration. For obtaining a fast iterative
solution of those non-symmetric systems, we derive efficient
preconditioners based on the approaches due to Wathen et al. [{\sc
  Elamn/Silvester/Wathen 2005, Stoll/Wathen 2011}]. Finally, we show
recent numerical results regarding the arising nested iteration.
